# liri-node-app

An app where the user gets to chose one of the following:
1. Read my-tweets
2. Spotify-this-song
3. Movie-this
4. do-what-it-says (this will display a song data, too)

Feel free to clone the app. To be able to use the app, one would need:
 to install the node modules
twitter (Visit https://apps.twitter.com/app/new) & 
spotify (Visit https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/) ids.
